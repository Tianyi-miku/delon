## Can't find G2

G2 built-in TypeScript definition file, in fact, G2 can't be used alone in Angular. Most of G2 needs to depend on `@antv/data-set` or other plugins, and these not definition files. In other words, using TypeScript import modules is not most friendly way ([#679](https://github.com/ng-alain/ng-alain/issues/679)). So `@delon/chart` use most primitive method, but there are still some details to be note:

- Import all G2 related dependencies in the `scripts` node of `angular.json`
- Define G2 related type definitions in `src/typings.d.ts`

Of course, the above [g2 plugin](/cli/plugin#g2) can be used in one step.

## About kcart.alipay.com request

In order to serve the users better, G2 will send the URL and version information back to the AntV server:

```ts
// app.components
export class AppComponent {
  constructor() {
    if (typeof G2 !== 'undefined') {
      G2.track(false);
    }
  }
}
```
